We have had some issues with binder and voila which we didn't manage to resolve in time. In particular the 
Error:

loading server extension voila
      X is voila importable?
 
In which we did not manage to find any documentation on this issue that helped for us. 

Trying to work around this, we also faced a number of 404 not found and 500 server side errors along with some unexpected compatibility issues with nbconvert version. 
Imagining that this would be a relatively straightforward task, we did not ask for help in time and unfortunately left it unfinished due to time constraints.
